Representations of simple things
================================

Vector (ie. a position)
-----------------------

```lua
vector.new(x, y, z)
```

See [Spatial Vectors] for details.

`pointed_thing`
---------------

* `{type="nothing"}`
* `{type="node", under=pos, above=pos}`
    * Indicates a pointed node selection box.
    * `under` refers to the node position behind the pointed face.
    * `above` refers to the node position in front of the pointed face.
* `{type="object", ref=ObjectRef}`

Exact pointing location (currently only `Raycast` supports these fields):

* `pointed_thing.intersection_point`: The absolute world coordinates of the
  point on the selection box which is pointed at. May be in the selection box
  if the pointer is in the box too.
* `pointed_thing.box_id`: The ID of the pointed selection box (counting starts
  from 1).
* `pointed_thing.intersection_normal`: Unit vector, points outwards of the
  selected selection box. This specifies which face is pointed at.
  Is a null vector `vector.zero()` when the pointer is inside the selection box.
  For entities with rotated selection boxes, this will be rotated properly
  by the entity's rotation - it will always be in absolute world space.
