Textures
========

Mods should generally prefix their textures with `modname_`, e.g. given
the mod name `foomod`, a texture could be called:

    foomod_foothing.png

Textures are referred to by their complete name, or alternatively by
stripping out the file extension:

* e.g. `foomod_foothing.png`
* e.g. `foomod_foothing`

Supported texture formats are PNG (`.png`), JPEG (`.jpg`) and Targa (`.tga`).
